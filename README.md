# Shorts_Clone
An application which can be used to watch videos similar to Youtube Shorts. It contains the same swipe-up and swipe-down functionality to change videos as seen in Youtube Shorts. The app uses a paginated approach to display the videos. This app was developed as a proof of concept during my internship at Vedic Systems Private Limited.
